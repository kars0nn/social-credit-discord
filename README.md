# social-credit-bot

Bot with code based off my super old Spotify bot. (private because embarrassing code)
Old code, super scuffed, feel free to modify it and create pull requests.

If you want to host this, you'll need to install mongodb on your machine,also run npm install when you pull the code. 

To use domains, just use nginx. 

Also if you find anything that might be personal to me in here, don't worry about it it's most likely irrelevant now lol


also make sure to run npm i discord.js@12.5.3 or whatever the last version of v12 was or else it won't work
